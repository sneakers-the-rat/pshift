% The phase vocoder is a time-scale modification algorithm. It rescales the
% time-axis of the input signal x according to the time-stretch function s
% without altering the pitch of x. The phase vocoder is particulary well
% suited for input signals of harmonic nature. For further details see
% [1966_FlanaganGolden_PhaseVocoder_BellTechnicalJournal].
